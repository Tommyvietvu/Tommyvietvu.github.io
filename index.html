    <p>My first childhood memories began with the exploration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">Anime<a />
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">Manga</a>
        and how it assimilated into my lifestyle as of now. The top anime and
        manga series that I loved reading and watching were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece">One Piece</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a> since they were one of the few mainstream anime and manga at the time.</p>

    <p>Growing up playing video games with my brothers was a joyous event for me
      because of the impact gaming has brought to my life.For me, playing video games is a source of
      energy and a way to cope with any stress. I still reminisce the past of playing video games - especially
      the old online video games such as <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/">World of Warcraft<a />, <a href="http://maplestory.nexon.net/landing">Maplestory</a>, <a href="https://www.runescape.com/splash">Runescape</a>, and so on. These
        memories
        will forever be ingrained in my heart and soul as I continue to progress in my future.</p>

  <p>These pictures are from a while back when I used to play these video games. Looking back at these pictures,
    the feeling of nostalgia hits back home hard when you remember the first time you step into this beautiful landscape
    or scenary and admire how good the graphics were back in the early 2000s.</p>
